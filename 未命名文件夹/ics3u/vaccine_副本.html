	<h1><center>vaccine</center></h1>
	<p>Vaccine is a preventive medical product that stimulates the human immune system to produce an immune response by introducing pathogens such as microorganisms, bacteria, viruses, or their parts, thereby improving the body's resistance to specific diseases.</p>

	<h2>1.How vaccines work:</h2>
	<p>Prevention of infectious diseases: Vaccines can help the body produce antibodies or cellular immune responses, making the body resistant to specific pathogens, thus preventing the occurrence of infections and diseases.
Controlling the spread of diseases: Through group vaccination and vaccination plans, the spread of diseases can be effectively controlled and the goals of social public health can be achieved.</p>
<h2>2. Types of vaccines:</h2>
<p>Virus vaccines: including inactivated vaccines, live attenuated vaccines, etc., which stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies by giving part or the whole virus to the human body.
Bacterial vaccines: For bacterial diseases, such as whooping cough, pneumococcus, etc., the human immune system is activated by introducing bacterial components or products.
Recombinant protein vaccine: Vaccine prepared using genetic engineering technology, such as HPV vaccine, influenza vaccine, etc.
Vector vaccine: The target antigen gene is inserted into a vector, and the vector expresses the antigen to induce an immune response.
DNA/RNA vaccine: uses DNA or RNA molecules to carry target pathogen genes and activates the immune system through the transfection mechanism.</p>
<h2>3.Importance of vaccines:</h2>
<p>Vaccines are one of the most effective means of preventing infectious diseases and have made important contributions to human health and social public health.
Through vaccination, many infectious diseases have been effectively controlled or eliminated, such as smallpox, polio, etc.
Overall, vaccines play a key role in preventing infectious diseases and maintaining public health and are one of the important achievements of medical science.</p>
