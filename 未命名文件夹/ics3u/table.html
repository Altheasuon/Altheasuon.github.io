<h2>Directions:<h2>
  <p>1.For the Scrambled Eggs: In a medium bowl, thoroughly whisk together eggs with salt, water, and 2 teaspoons (10ml) oil.</p>
  <p>2.Heat a well-seasoned carbon steel wok (see note) over high heat until lightly smoking. Add 2 tablespoons (30ml) oil, swirling to coat wok. Add eggs, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook, allowing eggs to form a solid layer at the bottom of the wok before slowly scrambling with a spatula, until eggs are gently scrambled in large curds, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer eggs to a plate and set aside. Wipe out wok of any remaining egg.</p>
  <p>3.To Finish: Return wok to medium-high heat and heat until very lightly smoking. Add remaining 3 tablespoons (45ml) oil and swirl to coat the wok. Add scallion whites and garlic and cook, stirring and tossing constantly, until fragrant, about 20 seconds; do not let them scorch. Add ginger and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 10 seconds.</p>
  <p>4.Add tomatoes, salt, and MSG (if using), and cook, stirring and tossing frequently, until tomatoes soften and their juices come to a boil.</p>
  <p>5.Add Shaoxing wine followed by the soy sauce, pouring each around the sides of the wok so that they sizzle. Season with salt.Reduce heat to medium, then add eggs and white pepper, stirring to combine and breaking up any very large egg curds. Continue to cook until tomato-egg mixture is thoroughly combined and heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.</p>
  <p>6.Reduce heat to medium, then add eggs and white pepper, stirring to combine and breaking up any very large egg curds. Continue to cook until tomato-egg mixture is thoroughly combined and heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.</p>
  <p>Stir in black vinegar, remove wok from heat, then stir in sesame oil, if using, and scallion greens. Transfer to a serving plate and serve immediately with rice.</p>
